Okay here are just some random ramblings of what I want the structure of things to look like:

At the top level we want to have a Scene class, which has several participants. It also has initiative order, and history of various things. The scene resolves attacks etc.
It should do so by iterating through rounds, then asking the current actor to take an action (aka attack other dude), and then resolving the attack.


Top level interfaces:
CombatActor
We'll have various combat actors that interact with each other. Should have initiative values, health etc.

Action
Should be between two people/actors, A launches attack at B. Should resolve in several steps, where both people get to reply with various charms/what have you.
